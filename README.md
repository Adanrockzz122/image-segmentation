Introduction
What is Image Segmentation?
Image segmentation is a technique used in computer vision to partition an image into multiple segments or regions, making it easier to analyze. The goal is to simplify the representation of an image or make it more meaningful, which helps in tasks such as object detection, feature extraction, and image compression.

There are different types of image segmentation:

Semantic Segmentation: Classifies each pixel in the image as belonging to a specific class (e.g., road, car). It doesn't differentiate between instances of the same class.
Instance Segmentation: Differentiates between distinct objects of the same class (e.g., two different cars).
Panoptic Segmentation: Combines both semantic and instance segmentation to provide a detailed image analysis.
What is Clustering in Image Segmentation?
Clustering in image segmentation is an unsupervised learning technique where similar pixels in an image are grouped into clusters based on certain features such as color, intensity, or texture. This method is used to divide the image into meaningful regions without requiring labeled data.

Popular Clustering Algorithms:
K-Means Clustering: A widely used clustering algorithm that partitions data into k clusters based on color or intensity similarity.
Mean Shift Clustering: Identifies modes in the feature space and is used for more complex segmentation tasks.
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Groups pixels based on density, which can be helpful for handling noise or irregular cluster shapes.
Methodology
This repository demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering for image segmentation and its evaluation with different values of k (number of clusters). The process involves the following steps:

Image Preprocessing: Converting images to a format suitable for clustering (e.g., resizing, grayscale conversion).
Clustering with K-Means: Segmenting the image into multiple regions using K-Means clustering with different values of k.
Optimal K-value Determination: Using the Elbow Method to identify the optimal value of k for better segmentation accuracy.
Grayscale Preprocessing: Converting images to grayscale before performing segmentation to simplify the clustering process.
Tasks Performed
Image Segmentation by Clustering (k=2, k=3, k=4):

These tasks demonstrate how different values of k affect image segmentation. The image is divided into k clusters, and the pixels are grouped accordingly to generate segmented images.
The results are displayed for k=2, k=3, and k=4 to showcase how varying the number of clusters changes the output of the segmentation.
Optimal K-value through Elbow Method:

The Elbow Method is applied to determine the best value of k for K-Means clustering. By calculating the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for various values of k, we identify the point where adding more clusters no longer significantly reduces the WCSS. This point, or "elbow," suggests the optimal k for the dataset.
